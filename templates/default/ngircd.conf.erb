# Comments are started with "#" or ";".
#
# A lot of configuration options in this file start with a ";". You have
# to remove the ";" in front of each variable to actually set a value!
# The disabled variables are shown with example values for completeness only
# and the daemon is using compiled-in default settings.

# Use "ngircd --configtest" (see manual page ngircd(8)) to validate that the
# server interprets the configuration file as expected!

[Global]
  # The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
  # configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
  # on which the server should be listening.
  # These settings depend on your personal preferences, so you should
  # make sure that they correspond to your installation and setup!

  # Server name in the IRC network, must contain at least one dot
  # (".") and be unique in the IRC network. Required!

  # Comma separated list of IP addresses on which the server should
  # listen. Default values are:
  # "0.0.0.0" or (if compiled with IPv6 support) "::,0.0.0.0"
  # so the server listens on all IP addresses of the system by default.
